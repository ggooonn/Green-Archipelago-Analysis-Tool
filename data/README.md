# Sample Data for GAAT

This directory contains a sample dataset (`GAAT_Sample_Data.gpkg`) required to run the Green-Archipelago-Analysis-Tool (GAAT) simulation.

## Contents

The GeoPackage file includes three feature layers, clipped to a single administrative district ('Dong') for demonstration purposes:

1.  `Sample_LandCover`: Land cover polygons based on the S. Korean Ministry of Environment's L3 classification.
2.  `Sample_GB_Boundary`: The greenbelt boundary polygon for the sample area.
3.  `Sample_Islands`: Urbanized 'island' polygons within the greenbelt boundary for the sample area.

## Source & License

This data is derived from the official **Land Cover Map (2020)** provided by the **Ministry of Environment, Republic of Korea (환경부)**.

The original dataset follows the **Korea Open Government License (KOGL) Type 1**, permitting use and modification with proper attribution. Please refer to the main project `README.md` for full details.
